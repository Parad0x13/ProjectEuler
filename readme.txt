On 20Oct13 I decided for certain that I want to solve all of Project Euler's equations. Currently as of today there are 441 total questions. I have a long ways to go since I've only answered 44 questions.

I wonder how long it will take me to answer all questions, I know I'll have to achieve a certain level of mathematical competence probably through school (which I really need to make sure I start up soon). Any futher updates on my feelings on my progress will be annotated here

On 2019.05.30.1939.EST I've decided to re-manage the way this entire repo is structured and fix some old issues
At this point not everything is properly renamed nor is the hierarchy of folders exactly how I want it
I've attempted to future-proof the puzzle naming conventions by using 4 digits. I hope they do 5 digit or more equations but I doubt it

Of note both puzzles 18 and 67 used the same source originally so that code is duplicated to keep the naming and hierarchy conventions
