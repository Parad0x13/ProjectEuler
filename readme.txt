On 20Oct13 I decided for certain that I want to solve all of Project Euler's equations. Currently as of today there are 441 total questions. I have a long ways to go since I've only answered 44 questions.

I wonder how long it will take me to answer all questions, I know I'll have to achieve a certain level of mathematical competance probably through school (which I really need to make sure I start up soon). Any futher updates on my feelings on my progress will be annotated here
